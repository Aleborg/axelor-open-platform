title: Format exported dates and times with client locale
description: |
  Setting `data.export.locale` to set a fixed locale for all exports.
  Setting `data.export.separator` defaults to ';'.
  Only numbers (integer, long, decimal) were formatted using client locale.
  Dates, times, and datetimes now also use client locale.
  Setting `date.format` is removed.
