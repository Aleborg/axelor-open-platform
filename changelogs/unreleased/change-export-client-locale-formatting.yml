title: Format exported dates and times with client locale
description: |
  Client locale is used for exports, unless `data.export.locale` is set.
  Only numbers (integer, long, decimal) were formatted using client locale.
  Dates, times, and datetimes now also use client locale.
  Setting `date.format` is removed.
